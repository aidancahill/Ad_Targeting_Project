customers on google and facebook ads platform to build out campaigns and gain insights into the customer base to be targeted.

to the digital marketer using it. This software use is not intended to be used for malicious behavior but to gather 
relevant information based on a specific customer. 

Overall Description

The software consists of two main functions one being the google trends function that collects data based on a 
users keyword input. The data is related queries to the imputed keyword and google search suggestions on the keyword as well. 
This data is collected and stored in a csv file so that non-technical users still can access and make use of its information. 
The second function is an api call to the facebook graph where customer interests are collected based on the user's input.
This data is again stored on a separate csv file inside of the programs directory to be used inside of both ad platforms google and facebook. 
The more technical documentation of the programs inner workings are inside of the program code.
